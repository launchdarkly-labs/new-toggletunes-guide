## Release the New Player Without the Risk!


DJ Toggle wants to give power back to the users! They want to enable a new track selector that allows users to select the songs they want to hear. Previously it would take weeks to ship a new version of ToggleTunes. 
Now, with the help of LaunchDarkly, new features can go live almost instantly, and be rolled back just as fast, heaven forbid something goes wrong.  

No new installs. No big reloads. Let’s get ship done! 


This is your starting point.

### Objective: Create the project’s first feature flag in LaunchDarkly


Open your LaunchDarkly project and click **Create Flag**:

### Creating your first flag

Copy and paste the fields from below into the `Name` field. The `Key` field should auto-populate.


<div className="flex items-center space-x-3">
  <span className="text-lg text-blue-500 font-bold">
    Flag Name:{" "}
  </span>
    <CopyField value="Release Tracklist" client:load />
</div>

{/* <div className="flex items-center space-x-3">
  <span className="text-lg text-blue-500 font-bold">Flag Key:</span>
  <CopyField value="release-tracklist" client:load />
</div> */}

Scroll down a bit and click on **Release** button to make the flag into a Release Flag.
