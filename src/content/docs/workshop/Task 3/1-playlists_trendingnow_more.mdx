## Shipping NEW UI Layout with Playlists and Trending Hits in a Safer Manner!

Our users want to have access to curated playlists as well as improved discovery features helping them discover the hottest new tracks. Our brilliant team developed the very advanced ToggleAI, enabling users to access curated playlists and new discovery features.

We want to avoid releasing a broken feature again to everyone, so we want our Developers to only see the new feature for testing purposes.

Let's ship these features, and keep the good vibes rollin'.

This is your starting point.

### Objective\: New Feature Flag
Open your LaunchDarkly project and click `3 - Release New Users Playlist`. We saved time and created the `Release` flag for you.

Now, we're ready to target our Developers.

Click **Add rule**.

Click **Target segments** in the dropdown.

### Targeting Only Internal Developer to Test New UI Feature in Production



You are creating your targeting rule to target who can only see the new feature.

In the dropdown, in the `Segments` field, click on **Developers**. This is a `segment` that we already created.

In `Rollout`, select **Available**.

{/* <img src='/targeting/6.png' /> */}

This feature will be toggled “off” for most of our users.  However, our Developers will be able to access these experiences by targeting these users specifically upon release.

Flip the switch from `Off` to **On**.

Click **Review and Save** to release the feature.

You have released the feature to **Developers** only!

Now go back to the app.

In the upper right hand corner,  **Click on the picture** to switch users.

In the upper right hand corner, it should be  **'Platinum, Developer'**.

Now you can see the new UI!

With our toggle and serve section set to “Available” and our Developer targeted correctly, Developer can see the new UI feature and test the feature in production. Bonus points for not breaking a sweat or writing a single line of code in the process.

## Task Done!
