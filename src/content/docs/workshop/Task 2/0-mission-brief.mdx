## Launching our Latest Feature - Saved Playlist!

Users want the ability to create and save their playlists in a sidebar component.

The developers have already prepped the code and it's ready, but we don't need to wait for the pipeline. Let's create our new feature, and release it to the users!

### Objective\: Another minute, another launch. Launch that new feature!

Open your LaunchDarkly project and click `2 - Release Saved Playlist Sidebar`. We saved time and created the `Release` flag for you.

Go through and flip on the switch to turn on the flag. Make sure it is `Available` when the flag is on.

Flip back to the site and you see that the sidebar is messed up with red and purple backgrounds!

With the power of LaunchDarkly, you can hide the broken component within 200 ms with a flip of a switch.

Flip the switch to hide the sidebar.
