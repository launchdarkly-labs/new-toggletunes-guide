## Launching our Latest Feature - Saved Playlist!

Users want the ability to create and save their playlists in a sidebar component.

The developers have already prepped the code and it's ready, but we don't need to wait for the pipeline. Let's create our new feature, and release it to the users!

This is your starting point.

### Objective\: Another minute, another launch. Launch that new feature!

Open your LaunchDarkly project and click `2 - Release Saved Playlist Sidebar`. We saved time and created the `Release` flag for you.

Click **Edit**.
<img src="/release2/2.png" />

Click the **dropdown** and choose **Available**.

Flip the switch from `Off` to **On**.
<img src="/release2/4.png" />

Click **Review and Save** to release the feature.

Flip back to the site and you see that the <span className="text-xl">sidebar is messed up with red and purple backgrounds!</span>

With the power of LaunchDarkly, you can hide the broken component within 200 ms with a flip of a switch.

Go back to the LaunchDarkly dashboard

Flip the switch from `On` to **Off**.
<img src="/release2/6.png" />

Click **Review and Save** to turn off the feature.

Now, the sidebar is gone.
