### Objective: Releasing new AD Bar with Release Edition for Protection

We also want to use LaunchDarkly's Release Edition feature to keep track of the app's latency and error rates after releasing the new UI to further insure we have a successful release.

### Flag Variations

Open your LaunchDarkly project and click `5 - Release New Ad Sidebar`. We saved time and created the `Release` flag for you.

Click **Edit**.

Click the **dropdown** and choose **Available**.

Click **Add rollout**.

In the dropdown, click **Guarded Rollout**.

In the new section `Guarded rollout setup`, in the `Metrics to monitor`, add the existing `metrics` **Website Error Rate** and **Website Latency Rate**.

These metrics are added in your app already and they send `error rate`and `latency rate` data from your app to LaunchDarkly.

Click the checkbox **Automatically roll back rule if a regression is detached**.

Click **Review and Save** to release the feature.

You now have **Release Edition** running on your app for the new sidebar ui!

Now go back to your app, and press have **Validate Release Guardian** to speed up the release guardian processs.
