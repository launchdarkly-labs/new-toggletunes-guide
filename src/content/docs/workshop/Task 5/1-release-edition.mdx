### Objective: Releasing new AD Bar with Release Edition for Protection

We also want to use LaunchDarkly's Release Edition feature to keep track of the app's latency and error rates after releasing the new UI to further insure we have a successful release.

### Flag Variations

Open your LaunchDarkly project and click `5 - Release New Ad Sidebar`. We saved time and created the `Release` flag for you.

Click **Edit**.

Click the **dropdown** and choose **Available**.

Click **Add rollout**.

In the dropdown, click **Guarded Rollout**.

In the modal, in the `Add guarded rollout metrics to your flag`, add the existing `metrics` **Website Error Rate** and **Website Latency Rate**.

These metrics are added in your app already and they send `error rate`and `latency rate` data from your app to LaunchDarkly.

Flip the switch from `Off` to **On** and click the checkbox **Automatically roll back rule if a regression is detached**.

Click **Review and Save** to release the feature.

You now have **Release Edition** running on your app for the new sidebar ui!

<h3> There is 50% change of seeing the AD Sidebar because of the release edition feature.</h3>
<h3> If you don't see the AD Sidebar on the right hand side, toggle the **user profile on the upper righthand side** until you see the AD Sidebar. </h3>

Now you should see the AD Sidebar
