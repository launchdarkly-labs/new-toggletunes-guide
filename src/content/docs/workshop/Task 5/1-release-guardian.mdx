## Releasing new AD Bar with Release Guardian for Protection

Thanks to your help, ToggleTunes is now one of the most popular music applications! Let's celebrate by rewarding our most loyal subscribers with exciting new features! DJ Toggle is launching a new platinum experience that offers new books, concerts, and more!

### Objective: Releasing new AD Bar with Release Guardian for Protection

We also want to use LaunchDarkly's Release Guardian feature to keep track of the app's latency and error rates after releasing the new UI to further insure we have a successful release.


### Flag Variations

Open your LaunchDarkly project and click `5 - Release New Ad Sidebar`. We saved time and created the `Release` flag for you.
